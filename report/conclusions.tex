\section{Conclusions}

In this project we build DNN and LGBM multi-label classifier to predict cancer type of tumor samples with arbitrary number of mutations with machine learning techniques. We described how we use machine learning to implement DNN and LGBM for multi-label classifier to predict cancer types, and evaluated the models. Our experimental result shows that prediction accuracy is up to 65.4\%.
