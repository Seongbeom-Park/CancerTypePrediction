\section{Introduction}

Since there are various symptoms for the cancer, it is hard to know cancer before it becomes critical. To overcome this problem, there are various ways are developed to diagnose cancer with blood test \cite{cohen2018detection, kalinich2018cancer}, because blood vessel is main carrier for the cancer metastasis to other organs or tissues.

Cancer type classifying is as important as cancer detection. To make tomography of a human body, there might be side effect due to radiation exposure with PET or CT scanning, and it is hard to discover small sized tumor with images before it developed.

This report addresses the way how we use machine learning techniques to classify the cancer type with DNA mutation of tumor samples. We use deep neural network (DNN) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) \cite{ke2017lightgbm} to build multi-label classifier. The model shows prediction accuracy up to 65.4\% and we discussed about the way how to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model.
